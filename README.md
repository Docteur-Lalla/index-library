Index Library
=============

Index is a tags based documents library for **GNU/Linux**.
This project is under **BSD** license.

Index is to store, sort and search documents with a powerful and simple command line interface. Each file is stored as an entry in the given directory (by default : */usr/share/index/entries*) and a sign is saved in the tag files in the tag directory (by default : */usr/share/index/tags*).

The user can use the four following command :
  - index-add
  - index-search
  - index-remove
  - index-shell

index-shell is a simple shell that keep an environment in mind (tags to work with) and give very short aliases for the long index command names (by default : *add sch rm*).
